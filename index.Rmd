# About {.unnumbered}

*Why should you learn R?*

It's...

- totally free!

- open-source

- a scripting language (reproducible and transparent)

- an established tool with tons of tutorials and help pages 

- an amazing and inclusive community 


## First steps {.unnumbered}

R = programming language that can be written directly into your computer's console/terminal

R-Studio = integrated development environment (IDE) with lots of features

Almost all R-users have both installed 


### R-Studio {.unnumbered}

Four panels: 

Top-left: scripting panel -- write and save code (may only open when you open a new file)

Bottom-left: console panel -- input/output that won't be saved

Top-right: environment panel -- dataframes, variables (and sometimes has other features too, depending on what you're working with)

Bottom-right: install and update packages, preview plots, read help files, and some other features


### R script (.R) {.unnumbered}

File -> New File -> R Script 

- simple: only code

- write lines of code in the order they are meant to be run

- run each line by clicking that line and pressing Control + R (on Windows) or Cmd + Enter (on Mac)

- output shows below, in console panel (number in bracket shows amount of output if there is more than one line)

- Try it out: 5 + 5 

- comments that are not read as code: #



### R-Markdown file (.Rmd) {.unnumbered}

File -> New File -> R Markdown

- R-Markdown: more complex, both code and text, can also include images and some basic formatting (## for headers)

- YAML information at top:

  ---

  ---

- text in whitespace = text (unlike in an R script)
  - keep notes or leave a record of your decisions

- code needs a code chunk -- type it with three backticks or use Insert in the top bar and select R
  
```{r}

```

Run code: 
- press Control + R (on Windows) or Cmd + Enter (on Mac) with your cursor in the line
- use green right-pointing arrow at right edge of code block
- arrow with line under it -> runs all code chunks above (but not the current one)

Output: 
- directly below code block in preview window

- Can also use (#) to denote lines that are comments and shouldn't be read as R code

## Packages

### Installing packages

*Packages* - extend basic R functions to add more complicated/specialized functionality

- CRAN: R Consortium's host for packages -- any advanced R-programmer can make and submit their packages, any R-user can download and use them

- Install packages once when you first use them
  - command in console (or Markdown): `install.packages("packagename")`
  - or use the panel at the lower right, under the Packages tab

Try it now with one of the most used packages by copying the following code into your console `install.packages("tidyverse")`


### Using packages

- `library()` command at beginning of script to use calls from that package -- will only work if you've already installed the package

- Good style: load all packages in first code block

- Error about not finding a package? You probably don't have it installed. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


In summary: You need to install a package once, but need to load it (using the library command) every time you start a new R session.  

#### Try it out

1. Try the following command:
```{r}
#beep(2)
```
What error message do you get?

Now install the package "beepr" and call the package to this session with a library call somewhere above the beep command (line above is enough.) Try running the command again (make sure your speakers are on -- but not too loud :D) 

2. Install and -load- the "cowsay" package and try the following command:
```{r}
#say(what = "Good luck learning R!", by = "chicken")
```
